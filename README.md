# Stumble_Game
Game made at Mizzou Game Jam in 2015. Theme of the game is supposed to promote safe consumption and planning ahead for rides home.
The version labeled as DrunkenHaze.zip can be opened in Unity as well as run on Mac. The version labeled as Stumble.zip is the IOS version of the same code with some small slight changes. For the purposes of examining my code look at the _Scripts folder inside DrunkenHaze.zip.
